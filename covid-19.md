### Covid-19 masks
#### Evidence
A neighbor calls across the fence to ask about whether she should wear a spare surgical mask to go to the grocery store, because 'you are a doctor, and should know'.* She is completly asymptomatic.

*and you should

#### Question
You respond that strong evidence exits that a mask will

#### Answers
a) diminish her risk of becoming infected
b) be of no be benefit 
*c) decrease the risk of her infecting others
d) decrease the risk of her infecting others and her risk of becoming infected

#### Discussion
There is strong evidence that if she were infected but not symptomatic, a surgical mask would diminish the her probability of infecting others. It may well be true that it will also decrease her risk of infection as well, but the evidence is not as strong. Thus, other answers may be correct, but the point of this question is the discussion. 

There are several broad mechanisms for disease transmission, in order of increasing infectivity:
1. Contact (casual touching - an infected surface, or more 'intimate' - blood, saliva)
2. Droplet (short-range: infected particles spread disease either by direct inhalation or via contact with the surfaces the particles are launched onto via sneezing, coughing, or talking)
3. Airbone (infected particles are inhaled as they float in the air)
Aerosolization is a mix of droplet and airborne, whereby droplet particles remain in the air for awhile, spread and eventually settle on surfaces.

There are three things about which there is currently generalized agreement:
- There is a shortage of masks and PPE gear
- N95 masks offer substantial protection, if worn correctly
- Standard 'surgical' masks worn by someone with COVID-19 infection decrease the risk of infecting contacts

How big is the covid-19 virus? - about 120 naonometers = 0.12 microns. What is the size of the pores in an N95 mask? Anout 0.3 microns - the '95' means that the barrier should filter 95% of particles > 0.3 microns. Nevertheless, two factors are relevant: 1) using the analogy to a team of football linebackers all trying to rush through a small doorway - individually they fit through, but the door is still effective in decreasing the influx; 2) there is strong evidence that with covid-19 (and many other pathogens), the viral load the recipient sees impacts both the risk of infection and the severity of the disease. The viral load is also highest in the early stages of the disease. There is increasing evidence that a large portion of those infected with covid-19 are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and that they may infect others (i.e., are shedding viral particles).

Space does not permit additional discussion of many relevant factors, such as the difficulty in fitting an N95 mask and proper mask wearing/technique. The data on the effectiveness of the various masks is also generally of poor quality. 

Both the CDC and the WHO had initially (at the time of this writing) recommended against widespread use of masks, at least partially because of supply issues, as well as questions of efficacy. However, the adage 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' may be relevant in this discussion. The improving ability to sterilize and reuse masks (with UV light, heat, etc) may allow wider use (particularly among health care personnel) without exacerbating the shortage of supplies. "Better safe than sorry', the reader will recall, is another old adage...
